## Store Manager

Projects developed at the end of block 23, in which I studied _Node.js, software architecture, and unitary tests_.

### How it works

This project consisted of creating routes, with the methods `POST`, `PUT`, `GET` and `DELETE` to access a database, creating a backend application. Also, I worked with [Joi](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.6.0) to create validations.
